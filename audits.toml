This is a stronger requirement than the built-in safe-to-deploy criteria,
motivated by Chromium's rule-of-two related requirements:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/rule-of-2.md#unsafe-code-in-safe-languages

This crate will not introduce a serious security vulnerability to production
software exposed to untrusted input.

Auditors are not required to perform a full logic review of the entire crate.
Rather, they must review enough to fully reason about the behavior of all unsafe
blocks and usage of powerful imports. For any reasonable usage of the crate in
real-world software, an attacker must not be able to manipulate the runtime
behavior of these sections in an exploitable or surprising way.

Ideally, ambient capabilities (e.g. filesystem access) are hardened against
manipulation and consistent with the advertised behavior of the crate. However,
some discretion is permitted. In such cases, the nature of the discretion should
be recorded in the `notes` field of the audit record.

Any unsafe code in this crate must, in general, be kept well-contained, and
documentation must exist to describe how Rust's invariants are being upheld
despite the unsafe block(s). Nontrivial uses of unsafe must be reviewed by an
expert in Rust's unsafety guarantees/non-guarantees.

For crates which generate deployed code (e.g. build dependencies or procedural
macros), reasonable usage of the crate should output code which meets the above
criteria."""

* 1.16.0 -> 1.16.1 audit in https://crrev.com/c/5650895

When auditing the changes in the 1.16.1 -> 1.16.3 delta it seems that:

* The changes correctly account for ZSTs:
    * Avoiding division-by-zero errors
    * Avoiding UB in `BoxBytes::drop`
* The changes preserve safety gurantees for nearby `unsafe` blocks

https://github.com/ia0/data-encoding/issues/75 was partially addressed via
`#[doc(hidden)]` added in https://github.com/ia0/data-encoding/pull/76, but the
original repro from issue #75 can still trigger Undefined Behavior through
public APIs exposed by the `data-encoding` crate (without using `unsafe`, and
without using APIs named something like `internal_field_do_not_use`).

Additionally, the discussion in
https://github.com/ia0/data-encoding/issues/124 leans toward `unsafe`
encapsulation at a crate level, requiring crate-**global** reasoning to
prove soundness of public crate APIs.  Specifically, the crate currently
has a internal function that can cause Undefined Behavior if the caller
doesn't uphold certain (implied, not explicitly documented) safety
requirements.  The fact that such function is not marked as `unsafe`
effectively means that safety audit can't terminate and use **local**
reasoning near `unsafe` expression boundaries.

I grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bfs\b'`, `'\bnet\b'`, `'\bunsafe\b'`.

All `unsafe` in `flate2` is gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "any_zlib")]`:

* The code under `src/ffi/...` will not be used because the `mod c`
  declaration in `src/ffi/mod.rs` depends on the `any_zlib` config
* 7 uses of `unsafe` in `src/mem.rs` also all depend on the
  `any_zlib` config:
    - 2 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 2 in `fn set_level` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 3 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Decompress`)

All hits of `'\bfs\b'` are in comments, or example code, or test code
(but not in product code).

There were no hits of `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bnet\b'`.

Grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bfs\b'`, `'\bnet\b'`, `'\bunsafe\b'`.

There were some hits for `net`, but they were related to serialization and
not actually opening any connections or anything like that.

There were 2 hits of `unsafe` when grepping:
* In `fn as_str` in `impl Buf`
* In `fn serialize` in `impl Serialize for net::Ipv4Addr`

Unsafe review comments can be found in https://crrev.com/c/5350573/2 (this
review also covered `serde_json_lenient`).

Version 1.0.130 of the crate has been added to Chromium in
https://crrev.com/c/3265545.  The CL description contains a link to a
(Google-internal, sorry) document with a mini security review.

I grepped for \"crypt\", \"cipher\", \"fs\", \"net\" - there were no hits.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3891618.

Changes in unsafe blocks are wrapping direct calls to `core::mem::transmute` with the `transparent_ref_from_store` wrapper.
No safety guarantees change, but providing the `transparent_ref_from_store` as a wrapper provides a convenient marker that this transmute operation is actually sound.

See https://crrev.com/c/6323349 for more audit notes.
