This is a stronger requirement than the built-in safe-to-deploy criteria,
motivated by Chromium's rule-of-two related requirements:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/rule-of-2.md#unsafe-code-in-safe-languages

This crate will not introduce a serious security vulnerability to production
software exposed to untrusted input.

Auditors are not required to perform a full logic review of the entire crate.
Rather, they must review enough to fully reason about the behavior of all unsafe
blocks and usage of powerful imports. For any reasonable usage of the crate in
real-world software, an attacker must not be able to manipulate the runtime
behavior of these sections in an exploitable or surprising way.

Ideally, ambient capabilities (e.g. filesystem access) are hardened against
manipulation and consistent with the advertised behavior of the crate. However,
some discretion is permitted. In such cases, the nature of the discretion should
be recorded in the `notes` field of the audit record.

Any unsafe code in this crate must, in general, be kept well-contained, and
documentation must exist to describe how Rust's invariants are being upheld
despite the unsafe block(s). Nontrivial uses of unsafe must be reviewed by an
expert in Rust's unsafety guarantees/non-guarantees.

For crates which generate deployed code (e.g. build dependencies or procedural
macros), reasonable usage of the crate should output code which meets the above
criteria."""

* There are 2 cases of `unsafe` in `src/external.rs` but they seem to be
  correct in a straightforward way - they just propagate the marker trait's

More directly, its current usage is just in HashMap, and its purposes are:

The bundled zlib C sources were not audited as a part of this. However, I did

There was no diff between zlib/ and https://zlib.net/fossils/zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz.

zlib-ng did not provide a version, so I ran diff across everything in zlib-ng's
commit history. The closest upstream SHA was
cf89cf35037f152ce7adfeca864656de5d33ea1e with 8 lines of output from
`diff --recursive . ../../libz-sys-1.1.12/src/zlib-ng/`. All of these referenced
